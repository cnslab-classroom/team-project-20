## Project Overview (~300 characters)

The goal is to develop a program that suggests the optimal route by considering the location and waiting times of rides at amusement parks, allowing visitors to use their time efficiently. Using object-oriented programming, each ride will be designed as an object with attributes such as location and waiting time, enabling the calculation of the optimal path. The project targets Lotte World and Everland, providing users with efficient routes based on the shortest distance and minimal waiting time so they can enjoy more rides.

## Key Features (~500 characters)

- **Ride Object Design**  
  - **Attributes**: Location coordinates, current waiting time, usage duration, recommended time slots, etc.  
  - **Methods**: Waiting time update function  

- **Amusement Park Object Design**  
  - **Attributes**: List of rides, current congestion level  
  - **Methods**: Calculate distances between rides, provide ride location information  

- **Route Optimization Algorithm**  
  - Use Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate the shortest distance or minimal waiting time from the current location to the next ride.  

- **User Interface**  
  - A user-friendly interface to visually provide optimal routes and waiting time information between rides.

With these features, users will receive optimized movement routes starting from their first chosen ride at Lotte World or Everland.
